    <ol>
        <li>Place the green beans in a large saucepan or pot with one inch of water. You may place

        they should still be firm and bright green.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and sugar; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until 
        starting to brown. Add the green beans and stir to coat with the oil. Stir in the soy sauce 
        mixture and simmer for a couple of minutes uncovered to reduce the sauce. Transfer the beans 
        to a serving dish and pour the sauce over them.</li>
